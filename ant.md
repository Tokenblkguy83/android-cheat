# ant

Contents of the `ant` generated by `android create project`.

Gradle, which is used by Android Studio, seems to be getting more support from Google, `ant` is likely to die.

## Most useful command

    ant clean && ant debug && ant installd

## Build

Build debug version of app:

    ant debug

Other versions:

    ant release
    ant instrument

TODO debug vs instrument?

## Install

Install the `debug` and `release` versions of the app:

    ant debug install
    ant release install

Requires that it has already been built before.

Or equivalently:

    ant installd
    ant installr

Specify device:

    ant -Dadb.device.arg='-s emulator-5554' installd

Uninstall:

    ant uninstall

## XML schema

This is a project ID:

    <project name="MyName">

Controls the name of the APKs generated under `bin/`. TODO: any other effect?

Changing this and reinstalling does not lead to multiple app installs.

## Using ant with modern Android projects

While Gradle is now the preferred build tool for Android projects, `ant` can still be used for certain tasks and legacy projects. Here are some tips on using `ant` with modern Android projects:

### Customizing the build process

You can customize the build process by modifying the `build.xml` file generated by `android create project`. This file contains various targets and tasks that define the build process. You can add custom tasks or modify existing ones to suit your needs.

### Integrating with Android Studio

Although Android Studio uses Gradle by default, you can still use `ant` for certain tasks by creating custom Gradle tasks that invoke `ant` targets. This allows you to leverage the power of `ant` while still using Android Studio as your primary development environment.

### Migrating to Gradle

If you have an existing `ant`-based project, it is recommended to migrate to Gradle to take advantage of the latest features and improvements in the Android build system. The Android Studio migration tool can help you convert your `ant` project to a Gradle project with minimal effort.

For more information on using `ant` with modern Android projects, refer to the official Android documentation.
